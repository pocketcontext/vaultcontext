# VaultContext

The `vaultcontext-demo` branch adds an opt-in disposable public demo. See
[demo operations](docs/demo-operations.md) for its separate persistent contact
service, reset controls and deployment prerequisites. The UI lives in
`pb_public/`; serving that directory alone provides a clearly labelled
interactive preview with no authentication or enrollment storage. The live UI
activates only after a valid `/api/demo/status` response from an enabled backend.
Demo users authenticate with any verified Google account, accept the current
terms, and use personal vaults until 00:00 UTC.
`vaultcontext init` checks enrollment/read access and whether an identity already
exists before prompting for a passphrase. An existing identity must be unlocked
with its existing passphrase; running `init` again never replaces it. CLI sign-in
and website enrollment must use the same Google account. Sharing and identity rewrap are
disabled in demo mode. All account/vault data is disposable; contact preferences
and bounded security logs live outside the daily reset.

This branch also requires identity-key signatures for non-demo passphrase
changes. Old clients fail closed on that operation; install the updated package
before adopting this server change. This branch's repository launcher pins tested
client commit `78e0308abed01c21ffee5ec6b35a2d037c3f6280`; that Git-based installation
uses the public repository without GitHub credentials. Demo visitors install the
skill from the explicit demo branch with `npx skills`. Dependencies come from public PyPI.
The public Docker deployment image includes the server, hooks, frontend, retention
service and the public skill launcher used to identify the tested client revision. Client dependencies are
installed on the visitor's machine, not into the server runtime.
See [demo validation evidence](docs/demo-validation.md) for the checks and remaining
provider/deployment gates.
Use `uv sync --locked` and `uv run --locked vaultcontext` for this checkout.

The public demo is served directly at `/`, with `/terms/` and `/privacy/`.
Retired `/demo` and hosted download paths return 404; no compatibility redirects
or installation archives remain. Existing wheel-backed launchers must be replaced
with the Git-backed skill. Lock active sessions before replacing their launcher.

`/api/demo/status` advertises `installation` with method `skills`, the public
branch-specific skill source, skill name, and `clientRevision`. The revision is
read from the packaged repository launcher. Missing or malformed launcher metadata
keeps `clientReady` false; the browser validates the contract before showing setup.
This is a configured installation contract, not a live probe of GitHub or npm.
The coding agent checks the installed launcher pin against the advertised revision.
Installation requires Node.js/npm, uv and public GitHub/PyPI connectivity.

Additional isolated validation:

```sh
uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_demo_*.py'
uv run --locked python tests/demo_backend.py --binary /path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/identity_rewrap.py --binary /path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_demo_installation.py
uv run --with playwright==1.60.0 python tests/demo_website.py
```

Current release controls and platform coverage: [common CI and deployment contract](docs/ci-and-deployment.md).

Encrypted personal and shared file vaults for humans and coding agents, built on PocketContext. Any file type is accepted as exact opaque bytes, initially up to 8 MiB per file. Names and descriptive metadata are encrypted too. A CLI and portable skill provide the file interface. The public demo page provides Google authentication, enrollment and a coding-agent onboarding prompt; encrypted file operations and unlocking stay in the client. Clipperz inspired the architecture; no Clipperz code or compatibility is included.

## Access and keys

Google Workspace login authenticates PocketBase's default `users` identity. It does not unlock encrypted data. Each account initializes an encryption/signing identity protected by a separate passphrase. The encrypted private-key bundle persists only on the server; unlocking downloads and decrypts it in process memory. Application tokens and verified public fingerprints may be cached locally, never the private-key bundle. There are no recovery keys. A lost passphrase without a usable unlocked session or enrolled macOS Keychain credential means lost access; Google account recovery cannot decrypt the vault. Optional macOS Keychain enrollment stores the passphrase locally, never the private-key bundle.

Personal vaults are private. Shared project vaults have one owner and explicit editor/reader members, initially within the configured Workspace. Verify recipient and writer public fingerprints through an independent trusted channel. New members receive retained history. Revoking a member blocks retrieval immediately and freezes writes until key rotation completes. Downloaded plaintext or keys cannot be recalled, and credentials contained in files may need separate provider rotation. Owners cannot remove themselves; owner transfer and identity-key replacement are not implemented.

The execution host and unlocked agent are trusted. The client retains keys in a same-OS-user Unix socket session, with a 15-minute default lifetime and explicit `lock`. Linux and macOS are supported client platforms. Python cannot promise perfect memory erasure or protect against a privileged host, swap or an agent already authorized to read local files. No stored content authorizes execution or sharing.

See [implementation brief](docs/implementation-brief.md), [data and trust model](docs/data-model.md), [API contract](docs/api-contract.md) and [deployment preparation](docs/deployment.md).

## Onboarding page

The hand-maintained demo page in `pb_public/` is served at `/` by the
application-owned frontend hook. Legal pages are `/terms/` and `/privacy/`.
No frontend build is required. Serve `pb_public` with a local static HTTP server
for a disconnected, synthetic preview. The page activates live authentication
only after validating `/api/demo/status`.

The root page has one coding-agent setup prompt and no installation-method switch.
It loads no analytics or third-party scripts. The vendored PocketBase SDK is
same-origin. JavaScript and CSS URLs carry SHA-256 cache versions; refresh their
HTML references after edits. Check mobile layout, keyboard disclosures, clipboard
success/failure, auth restoration, consent and daily reset with:

```sh
uv run --with playwright==1.60.0 python tests/demo_website.py
```

## Local server

Build the exact commit in `POCKETCONTEXT_VERSION` with its `go.mod` toolchain, CGO and a C compiler. Keep it in a separate checkout if your existing server revision differs:

```sh
# In the pinned PocketContext checkout:
make build
# In this repository, with a disposable database for evaluation:
/absolute/path/to/pocketcontext serve --dir /absolute/private/test/pb_data --http 127.0.0.1:8090
```

The application directory supplies migrations, hooks and SQL configuration. No users or real records are seeded. Operators provision test identities through ordinary maintenance APIs; the CLI never uses superuser credentials.

Production Google settings use a separate Web OAuth client, paired `VAULTCONTEXT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `VAULTCONTEXT_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `VAULTCONTEXT_GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN`. Server-side verified claims enforce the exact Workspace domain. Direct public signup is blocked. Without a configured domain, Google login requires preprovisioned identities. Disable the application account to revoke its tokens; Google suspension alone does not invalidate existing app sessions.

## Portable client

The primary demo path is to paste the website's setup instructions into your coding
agent. Node.js/npm and uv are prerequisites. From the intended agent workspace:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/pocketcontext/vaultcontext/tree/vaultcontext-demo/skills/vaultcontext --skill vaultcontext --yes
```

Add `--agent codex` or `--agent claude-code` to target a specific coding agent.
Load the installed skill before using its bundled launcher. The explicit branch
selects the demo-compatible instructions; the short `pocketcontext/vaultcontext`
source currently selects a different default-branch release. The repository is
public and installation needs no GitHub credentials. Enrollment and Google login
are separate from installation; passphrases stay in the user's private terminal.
The demo does not host client downloads; use the installed skill launcher.

To use a launcher from a checkout directly, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
and copy it onto PATH:

```sh
install -Dm755 skills/vaultcontext/vaultcontext ~/.local/bin/vaultcontext
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
export VAULTCONTEXT_URL=https://vault.example.com
export VAULTCONTEXT_USER_EMAIL=you@example.com
vaultcontext login
```

`vaultcontext login` always starts Google OAuth. The former `--google` flag and CLI password login have been removed; update existing scripts to use plain `login`. `VAULTCONTEXT_USER_PASSWORD` is no longer supported. This changes sign-in only: initializing and unlocking the encrypted identity still require a separate vault passphrase.

The launcher declares its Python requirements and pins the client package to a full Git commit. It can run from any directory without neighboring source files. The first run needs network access to download the package, Python if needed, and dependencies; later runs reuse uv's cache. Updating the copied launcher adopts its new client revision. Before replacing an installed client, run its `lock` command for each configured server/account with an unlocked session. After updating, have the user run `vaultcontext unlock` explicitly in their private terminal so the session uses the new client; installation never unlocks automatically. The skill has no script lockfile: transitive dependencies may resolve differently on fresh installations. The repository's `uv.lock` governs development and tests, not launcher execution.

To migrate from the old `vc` launcher, run `vc lock` before installing `vaultcontext`, then remove only the old VaultContext launcher you installed (for example, `~/.local/bin/vc`). The package and skill provide no `vc` alias or compatibility wrapper. Update scripts to call `vaultcontext`. Existing authentication configuration and macOS Keychain enrollment remain valid.

The memory session runs in a fresh Python process using the launcher's own interpreter and installed package environment. Unlock waits for worker readiness; verified keys cross only a private inherited socket, never arguments, environment variables or files. Lock sessions before clearing uv's cache. `unlock`, `lock` and `logout` recover an abandoned socket only after checking ownership, permissions and connection refusal; ambiguous or unsafe endpoints remain errors. Repeating `lock` on an already locked account succeeds.

Alternatively, install the package from a trusted checkout into an external Python 3.11+ virtual environment. This provides the same `vaultcontext` command without requiring uv at runtime:

```sh
python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/vaultcontext-venv
~/.local/share/vaultcontext-venv/bin/pip install /absolute/path/to/vaultcontext
~/.local/share/vaultcontext-venv/bin/vaultcontext login
```

Run `vaultcontext` or `vaultcontext --help` for grouped commands and a first-use example, or `vaultcontext COMMAND --help`
for arguments, prerequisites and examples. Commands return JSON except `cat`,
which writes exact file bytes to stdout. Help does not require configuration or sign-in.

Use the chosen `vaultcontext` command for `whoami`, `check`, `init`, `unlock`, and subsequent operations. `init` and ordinary `unlock` prompt in an interactive terminal. On macOS, opt in with `vaultcontext keychain-enroll`, then use `vaultcontext unlock --keychain` to retrieve the saved passphrase after Touch ID or macOS credential authentication. This requires the signed native helper; see [macOS Keychain setup and trust model](docs/macos-keychain.md). Never pass unlock secrets through chat, arguments, environment variables or pipes. Over SSH, forward Google callback port 8765 as described in the [skill workflows](skills/vaultcontext/references/workflows.md); decryption still occurs on the machine running the CLI. Configuration must be available wherever the command runs; a workspace `.envrc` may not be loaded outside that workspace.

The [skill](skills/vaultcontext/SKILL.md) includes the launcher and operation references. It supports vault creation, arbitrary-file saves, local name search, version history, private equality checks, exact restores, invitations, memberships, revocation/rotation, encrypted export and independent archive restore. Agents manage files and metadata but never inspect file contents, including source or restored files. The dedicated `compare` command may answer a requested equality check without exposing contents or hashes. Content viewing with `cat` is for users in their own private terminals. This skill rule does not remove the CLI or unlocked session's decryption capability. Saving again with `--document` creates a new immutable version. The default encrypted display name preserves the exact source-path argument (after shell expansion), including relative or absolute directories; `--name` overrides it. Names are labels, not unique identifiers or restore destinations. Existing versions keep their names. No format-specific parsing, automatic synchronization or shell activation occurs.

`vaultcontext archive DOCUMENT_ID` hides a document and all its versions from default `list` and `search`; `--archived` selects archived documents and `--all` selects both. Owners and editors can archive or `unarchive`; readers cannot. Repeating either action is harmless. Archived documents retain `history`, `cat` and `restore` access by ID, but reject new versions until unarchived. Archiving changes neither access nor retention: exports, complete backups and whole-vault sharing include archived documents. Archive state is document metadata, distinct from an encrypted export archive.

Listings and name searches fetch selected version metadata in batches and reuse verified
keys only for the current command. Every version's signature and document binding
are still checked; subsequent commands recheck access and fingerprints. SQL reads
that receive HTTP 429 retry at most twice, waiting 10 seconds each time. Writes
are never automatically replayed after rate limiting.

`vaultcontext compare DOCUMENT_ID LOCAL_PATH` compares a local file with the current saved version; add `--version VERSION_ID` to select history. It requires login and an unlocked session and returns document/version IDs, a `same` boolean and a comparison `method`, never contents or hashes. New saves include a SHA-256 checksum of the plaintext inside encrypted, signed version metadata. For those versions, comparison downloads metadata only (`encrypted-sha256`); it reads local bytes internally to compute their checksum. Older versions use `legacy-download`, downloading and verifying the stored bytes in memory without plaintext temporary files. No existing version is rewritten. Hash equality has negligible collision risk, but does not prove that stored ciphertext remains downloadable or recoverable. Use backup/restore validation for recovery assurance.

`vaultcontext cat DOCUMENT_ID` outputs the current file; add `--version VERSION_ID` for a historical version. It verifies the entire file before output, creates no plaintext temporary files, and adds no formatting or newline. Binary data and terminal control characters pass through unchanged. Output can expose secrets to the terminal, pipes or captured logs. Shell redirection uses ordinary shell permissions and overwrite behavior; use `restore` for protected disk writes. Neither command executes file contents.

Restores require explicit paths and existing parent directories, reject symlinks and preserve byte contents with mode 0600. Existing destinations require `--overwrite`. Original executable bits, permissions, ownership and source absolute paths are not restored. An `.envrc.private` restored into a direnv-enabled directory can execute later when the user's shell loads it; the client never activates it.

## Storage and backups

Metadata reads use authenticated requester-filtered SQL. Writes use the standard REST `vault_actions` collection and transactional hooks; action payloads are not persisted. Encrypted file chunks use protected file storage and authenticated downloads so file bytes do not exhaust SQL snapshot budgets. Independent rules cover file downloads, REST and realtime. There is no implicit operator decryption access.

Complete recovery requires the database replica and every referenced ciphertext object, verified against its stored checksum. A database-only backup is insufficient. Startup must refuse missing/corrupt originals. An ordinary data export instead decrypts accessible file versions in memory and encrypts an archive under a separately entered archive passphrase; it includes no identity private keys or live vault-key envelopes. Exports restore without the server, but cannot recover a forgotten live-vault passphrase. Export plaintext is capped at 64 MiB including base64 overhead and metadata. New exports use format v2 to retain document archive status and require an updated CLI to inspect or restore. The updated CLI also reads existing v1 exports.

## Validation

Use synthetic fixtures and isolated temporary databases only. From this repository, install the locked development environment and run:

On macOS, first run `export TMPDIR=/private/tmp` in the test shell. The default
temporary path traverses the `/var` symlink, which the client's safe file handling
intentionally rejects. The unit suite compiles the native Keychain helper with
Apple's Swift command-line tools on macOS; its rejection tests never access Keychain.

```sh
uv sync --locked
uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
uv run --locked python tests/integration.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/archive_migration.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/realtime.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/limits.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/backup_integration.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/auth.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/oauth_integration.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/oauth.py

uv run --locked python tests/deploy.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext
uv run --locked python tests/deploy_workflow.py
```

Container configuration, smoke and populated complete-restore checks gate image publication; see deployment documentation for commands. Real Google browser/provider configuration and independent security review are separate from synthetic tests. Actual verification results and remaining limitations are recorded in `docs/validation.md`.

VaultContext is deployed at `https://vault.pocketcontext.com`; see [release evidence](DEPLOYMENT.md). The source repository and Docker deployment image are public. This demo branch advertises the public Git-backed skill; it does not host client downloads or install the client into the server runtime. The image workflow supports automatic production deployment after successful publication through the `once-pocketcontext-v2` restricted dispatcher. `CONTEXT_DEPLOY_PAUSED=true` pauses deployment without pausing CI or publication; see [deployment controls](docs/deployment.md#single-writer-updates-and-rollback).

Identity, OAuth and deployment patterns are adapted from RaiseContext; filtered access and complete-original backup patterns follow AccountContext. Their domain schemas and readers are not copied.

## Client launcher releases

Commit and push the tested package implementation first. Update `skills/vaultcontext/vaultcontext` to that full commit SHA, then validate the remotely installed client before committing and pushing the launcher:

```sh
uv run --locked python tests/skill.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext --client skills/vaultcontext/vaultcontext
uv run --locked python tests/cli_forward.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext --client skills/vaultcontext/vaultcontext
```

These checks copy only the executable into a temporary directory. The launcher intentionally has no adjacent lockfile; keep the root development lockfile separate. A copied launcher must be replaced to adopt a later client revision.

## Runtime maintenance freeze

Superusers use `GET /api/context/maintenance` and generation-checked
`PUT /api/context/maintenance` with `{"readOnly":true,"expectedGeneration":N}`
to drain and block writes without restarting. Existing authorized reads and
protected original downloads remain available. Authentication that creates or
updates records is blocked; preserve an existing operator token for thaw.
Set `readOnly:false` with the returned generation to resume writes explicitly.

The private durable `pb_data/maintenance.json` marker survives restart. Frozen
startup requires the existing database, skips restore and superuser/settings
provisioning, verifies original files, and refuses pending migrations. Malformed
markers fail closed. Litestream supervision remains active; this is a
managed database/API freeze, not cross-host writer fencing or byte-immutable disk.
Keep the marker with migration snapshots and fence the source before cutover.

Validate with `python3 tests/entrypoint.py` and
`python3 tests/maintenance.py --binary /absolute/path/to/pinned/pocketcontext`.

Replicated startup waits for a private Litestream IPC synchronization before
serving, including fresh Google-only databases. A failed initial sync refuses
traffic; clean early shutdown therefore uses an initialized replica.

## Container startup and primary object storage

Set all of `VAULTCONTEXT_S3_BUCKET`, `VAULTCONTEXT_S3_ENDPOINT`,
`VAULTCONTEXT_S3_REGION`, `VAULTCONTEXT_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and
`VAULTCONTEXT_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to use a dedicated private S3/R2 bucket
for PocketBase uploads. `VAULTCONTEXT_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` defaults to `true`.
The container requires complete S3 and Litestream configuration; `LITESTREAM_DISABLED` is rejected. Partial configuration and shared primary/replica buckets or access keys fail closed. This is primary file storage, separate from
the `LITESTREAM_*` SQLite replica bucket and prefix. Protected downloads still
require independent application authorization. Vault ciphertext stays encrypted.

Default startup preserves an existing database or strictly restores SQLite through
Litestream into a temporary directory. It verifies database integrity and streams
every referenced remote file before installing the restored database. Ciphertext
chunks must match their stored SHA-256; other file fields, including avatars, are
checked for readability and complete responses because they have no stored hash.
No legacy archive scheduler or restore remains in the container. Direct pinned-server
development may still use local synthetic storage. Keep object retention independent of replica retention;
SQLite replication alone cannot recover deleted objects. Unexpected crashes can
lose database writes since Litestream is asynchronous.

This configuration does not move existing files. Copy and checksum all referenced
objects before enabling it. A frozen startup refuses any storage configuration
change: prepare the destination settings before establishing its frozen snapshot.
Preserve `maintenance.json`, pause CD, and fence the source before thawing a
destination. Never point a second writable process at the live replica.

Run `python3 tests/object_storage_settings.py` plus the documented backup,
maintenance and deployment tests. Use `tests/object_storage_integration.py --binary /path/to/pinned/server
--synthetic-bucket BUCKET` with a disposable local MinIO bucket and the S3
environment above for real uploads, protected downloads and database-only recovery.
Container and Litestream fresh-volume recovery validation remain release gates.

### Container primary-storage recovery gate

After building the image, run the existing `docker/smoke.py config`, `smoke`,
and `restore` checks (use the locked Python environment). `restore` runs
`docker/object_storage_smoke.py`; either command executes the same populated gate. The restore check builds
its pinned local MinIO fixture. The primary-storage check uses separate bucket-scoped
synthetic keys, uploads real protected files, rejects unrelated-user downloads,
and tests frozen restart plus a new destination volume. It compares every main
database table restored by Litestream before destroying the source volume and
explicitly thawing the destination. A final upload and clean stop are followed
by destruction of that volume and automatic entrypoint recovery into a third
empty volume, with authorized and denied protected-file checks. No cloud buckets
or live replicas are used.

A **frozen handoff bundle** must also carry `maintenance.json` and a consistent
SQLite backup of `auxiliary.db` from the stopped source: frozen startup refuses
to create a missing auxiliary database. The main `data.db` still comes from
Litestream. A writable disaster recovery can recreate auxiliary state, but must
not be substituted for a deliberately frozen migration. Keep source fencing and
this bundle explicit in migration tooling.

A genuinely new installation requires one explicit container `init` invocation with
its intended private configuration and volume, followed by ordinary startup on that
same volume. `init` refuses existing local state or a populated replica; default
startup refuses a missing replica. Never initialize an existing deployment or a
recovery volume. Interrupted initialization leaves `initialization.pending` and
blocks startup; preserve it for investigation. See [deployment commands](docs/deployment.md).

The container uses one Python entrypoint, tini and Litestream; Python execs the
supervisor and its server child after preparation. Historical archive recovery
uses the previous pinned image in an isolated environment. Test-only legacy archive
helpers remain under `tests/` and are excluded from the image. No old archives are deleted.
